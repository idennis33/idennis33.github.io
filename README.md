The different techonologies I used were originally tried to make a bunch of different functions that run the different levels. However ran into problems were it was all being ran in the console but not the DOM. So I reappoarched it where I decided to make a class called Question which had parameters of question and answer. From there I put the the instances of quesitons into a array called questions. I then made if statements for my on click functions for my submit and my new question button. So in the new button if a certian condition is met then the funcitons would invoke a endGame funciton. That would ask if the user(s) want to play again. If the user doesn't want to play again then I would remove the id of message and add a new text of Game Over. Telling the user the game is over.

///// Unsolved Problems /////
I had a problem where my code wouldn't actaully read the array postions correctly. Like poistion 0 wasn't the first question then the last question q5 wasn't the last index of the array. Another unsolved problem was that the timer ran as soon as I enter the webpage and I would have liked to have it start once I actually gotten through the startGame function. 

//// Future Updates //// 
I think adding some more questions, maybe actually having clickable choices, and a place where the players score could have been kept would be some nice future updates.
